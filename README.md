# Cine Guide
Cine Guide is an small iOS Application that interacts with the Trakt.tv API showing the most popular movies and has a search movie feature written in Swift 2.2

# Features
- When the app is launched, a list of the 10 most popular movies is displayed.
- As soon as the user scrolls down and reaches the end of the list, the next 10 movies are loaded.
- The other functionality is the search: the user should have the possibility to search for a movie by keyword. It is important that the search is automatically triggered, i.e. the search is automatically executed while typing the search term. When the user continues typing, the old search should be cancelled and a search for the new term must be started.
- The search results should be scrollable via pagination as well.
- Important properties to show in the search results are the movie title (title), the year of release (year), the overview (overview) without truncation and a picture.
